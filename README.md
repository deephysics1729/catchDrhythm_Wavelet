# Time domain analysis: Discrete and continuous wavelet transform

## Content

While the Fourier analysis of an oscillatory signal cannot achieve time-frequency localization and moreover, it often introduces numerical artifacts like overshoot (Gibb’s phenomena), etc.,  the scalogram constructed from the wavelet coefficients of the same signal can precisely determine the dominant frequencies in the particular time window. In this module, we learn about the properties of wavelets, different types of discrete and continuous wavelets, namely Haar wavelet, Daubechies wavelet, and Morlet wavelet, and use them to extract useful information from standardized time series data. We successfully recover the dominant 11-year cycle in the reconstructed solar activity data spanning the past millennium. Approximate and detailed wavelet coefficients are calculated at different decomposition levels, followed by reconstruction of the original signal in terms of low- and high-pass components. We also demonstrate the energy flow from one set of dominant frequencies to others at different temporal epochs of the signal. ‘Edge effect’ in the wavelet spectrum is discussed, and the statistical significance of various frequency components is evaluated using the ‘cone-of-influence’ study.
